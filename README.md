1) make animations that only play once (mine, axe) -> observer sucks. Only for player, so player class should have a state machine
2) fix the npc hit box bug / next player position bug
3) snapshot needs updating whenever movement occurs
4) changes to the navigation data: should be a data container, providing routes to the outside. Route stored locally
5) add hit boxes back into the game (in the Frame class)


NEXT ON THE LIST:
inventory and its related classes
