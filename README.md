1) fix the npc hit box bug / next player position bug
2) snapshot needs updating whenever movement occurs
3) changes to the navigation data: should be a data container, providing routes to the outside. Route stored locally
4) add hit boxes back into the game (in the Frame class)


NEXT ON THE LIST:
reset the delta of an item when changing indices
remove the next activity and route from the npcs
remove the actions from the code, for now
create a map and add it to the game!
